# CheeseOS-21.1.21
Welcome to CheeseOS 21.
CheeseOS is an open source operating system.

Updates:

CheeseOS 21 brings a new launchpad, which will open an application on the users desktop. It also comes with bug fixes to the File Explorer to stop the user from overwriting system files. You can always open up the CheeseOS folder in your host operating system to modify the files if you would like.
